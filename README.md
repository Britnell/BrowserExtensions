A little play with social media

Well then. I was learning a little Javascript and wanted to try creating my own Web-extension.

So, inspired by the ingenious [Herp Derp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/herp-derp-for-youtube/ioomnmgjblnnolpdgdhebainmfbipjoh) for YouTube, I decided to write my first extension for facebook.

# To Run the extension yourself

# 1. Download the folder

Download the folder "facebook-mirror", and leave it somewhere in your documents.

## In Chrome

1. Go to ["chrome://extensions"](chrome://extensions)
2. Tick the box "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
4. Go into the folder you downloaded ".../facebook-mirror",  and click "open"
5. It should now be in your list of extensions.

You can remove it, enable it and disable it here any time.
